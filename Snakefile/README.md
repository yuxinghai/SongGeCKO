This is crispr screen workflow for Songlab


1/ Evaluate Quality of R1.
2/ Find 5â€™adaptor TCTTGTGGAAAGGACGAAACACCG
3/ Extract sequence before as stagger+barcode
4/ Extract 20nt after as sgRNA
5/ Find the genes with enriched sgRNA comparing A* vs. NC-A*. (A/B: two sgRNA libraries; -1, -2: replicates)


NOTE

    KEGG analysis

    Non-target sequence    it's normal ,because self mutation or The same cell is not infected with a virus

    In order to solve the NC-A1 & NC-A2 correlation is low, the decision to merge the NC data and then enrich the comparison, while the A / B library number of 0 sgRNA speak not to analyze
